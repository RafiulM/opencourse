# Advanced Filtering, Sorting, and Search Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

I have successfully implemented comprehensive filtering, sorting, and search capabilities for all paginated routes in the OpenCourse backend API.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Validation Utilities
- Added advanced query validation and parsing in `src/lib/validation.ts`
- Created specific validation functions for each entity type:
  - `validateCommunityQueryOptions`
  - `validateCourseQueryOptions`
  - `validateEnrollmentQueryOptions`
  - `validateScoreboardQueryOptions`
  - `validateUploadQueryOptions`

### 2. Enhanced Service Layer
- **CommunityService**: Added filtering by privacy, createdBy, isVerified, memberCount, dates; sorting by multiple fields; search in name/description
- **CourseService**: Added filtering by communityId, instructorId, isPublished, isFeatured, difficulty, price, duration, enrollmentCount, dates; sorting by multiple fields; search in title/description
- **EnrollmentService**: Added filtering by userId, courseId, status, progress, dates; sorting by multiple fields
- **UserScoreService**: Added filtering by userId, points, coursesCompleted, quizzesPassed, averageQuizScore, streak, dates; sorting by multiple fields for leaderboards
- **UploadService**: Added filtering by uploadType, status, associations, mimeType, fileSize, dates; sorting by multiple fields; search in filenames

### 3. Enhanced Route Layer
- Updated all paginated routes to use new validation functions
- Added support for query parameters:
  - `page` and `pageSize` for pagination
  - Entity-specific filter parameters
  - `search` for text search
  - `sort` for field sorting with +/- prefixes

### 4. Technical Implementation
- Type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Efficient database queries using drizzle-orm
- Proper error handling and validation
- Backward compatibility with existing APIs

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Server running and responding to requests
- API endpoints functional with new query parameters

## Examples

### Community Filtering
```
GET /api/communities?page=1&pageSize=20&privacy=public&isVerified=true&search=programming&sort=-memberCount,+name
```

### Course Filtering
```
GET /api/courses?page=1&pageSize=20&communityId=123&isPublished=true&difficulty=intermediate&search=javascript&sort=-enrollmentCount,+title
```

### Enrollment Filtering
```
GET /api/enrollments/user/123?page=1&pageSize=20&status=enrolled&sort=-progress,+enrolledAt
```

### Leaderboard Filtering
```
GET /api/scoreboard/communities/123/leaderboard?page=1&pageSize=50&totalPointsMin=100&sort=-totalPoints,+streak
```

### Upload Filtering
```
GET /api/uploads/my?page=1&pageSize=50&uploadType=course_thumbnail&status=completed&search=course&sort=-createdAt
```

The implementation is now complete and ready for use. All paginated routes support advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.
