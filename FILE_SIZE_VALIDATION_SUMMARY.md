# File Size Validation Implementation Summary

## Overview

File size validation has been implemented across the backend and frontend to enforce upload limits based on upload types. Previously, there were no file size limits enforced on the backend, which could lead to security and performance issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Validation Rules (`apps/backend/src/lib/upload-validation.ts`)

- **New file created** with comprehensive upload validation rules
- **File size limits** defined for each upload type:
  - `community_avatar`: 2MB
  - `community_banner`: 5MB
  - `course_thumbnail`: 3MB
  - `module_thumbnail`: 2MB
  - `user_avatar`: 1MB
  - `material_video`: 500MB
  - `material_file`: 100MB
  - `material_document`: 50MB
- **MIME type validation** for each upload type
- **Image dimension limits** for image uploads
- **Validation functions**:
  - `validateFileSize()` - checks file size against limits
  - `validateMimeType()` - validates MIME types
  - `getMaxFileSize()` - returns maximum allowed size

### 2. Backend Upload Service (`apps/backend/src/services/upload.ts`)

- **File size validation** added to `generatePresignedUploadUrl()` method
- **MIME type validation** added to ensure file types match upload type
- **New method** `getMaxAllowedFileSize()` to retrieve size limits
- **Validation errors** thrown before generating presigned URLs

### 3. Backend Upload Routes (`apps/backend/src/routes/uploads.ts`)

- **File size parameter** added to presigned URL generation endpoint
- **Size validation** in route before calling service
- **New endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/uploads/validation-rules` - returns all validation rules
  - `GET /api/uploads/max-file-size/:uploadType` - returns size limit for specific type
- **Enhanced validation** in complete upload endpoint to verify final file size

### 4. Frontend Upload Service (`apps/frontend/lib/upload-service.ts`)

- **File size included** in presigned URL requests
- **New methods**:
  - `getValidationRules()` - fetches all validation rules from backend
  - `getMaxFileSize()` - gets size limit for specific upload type
  - `validateFileSize()` - validates file size against backend limits
  - `validateFileSizeFrontend()` - fallback frontend validation

## Validation Flow

### 1. Presigned URL Generation

```
Frontend → Backend (with fileSize) → Validation → Presigned URL
```

- File size validated against upload type limits
- MIME type validated against allowed types
- Presigned URL only generated if validation passes

### 2. Upload Completion

```
Frontend → Backend (with final fileSize) → Re-validation → Completion
```

- Final file size validated again before marking as complete
- Ensures uploaded file matches expected size

### 3. Frontend Validation

```
File Selection → Size Check → Type Check → Upload
```

- Early validation before upload starts
- Fallback to frontend rules if backend unavailable

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents malicious large file uploads
2. **Performance**: Limits storage and bandwidth usage
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages for size violations
4. **Consistency**: Same validation rules across frontend and backend
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify limits per upload type
6. **Fallback**: Frontend validation when backend unavailable

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints

- `GET /api/uploads/validation-rules` - All validation rules
- `GET /api/uploads/max-file-size/:uploadType` - Size limit for type

### Enhanced Endpoints

- `POST /api/uploads/presigned-url` - Now accepts `fileSize` parameter
- `POST /api/uploads/:uploadId/complete` - Now validates final file size

## Error Handling

- **Size validation errors** return HTTP 400 with descriptive messages
- **Type validation errors** return HTTP 400 with allowed types
- **Logging** added for debugging validation failures
- **Graceful fallbacks** when validation services unavailable

## Configuration

File size limits can be easily modified in `apps/backend/src/lib/upload-validation.ts`:

```typescript
export const uploadValidation: Record<UploadType, FileValidationRules> = {
  community_avatar: {
    maxSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2MB - easily changeable
    // ... other rules
  },
}
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive logging for testing:

- File size validation results
- MIME type validation results
- Upload flow tracking
- Error condition logging

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic limits** based on user roles or subscription tiers
2. **File compression** for large uploads
3. **Progressive validation** during upload
4. **Admin interface** for modifying limits
5. **Usage analytics** and reporting
