# Tech Stack Document for OpenCourse

This document explains the technologies chosen for the OpenCourse platform in everyday language. It covers why each tool or framework was selected and how they work together to create a reliable, maintainable, and secure system.

## Frontend Technologies

At the moment, the OpenCourse repository focuses on the backend service. However, it is designed to work smoothly with any modern frontend application. Here’s how:

-  **RESTful API Interface**  
   The backend exposes well-defined HTTP endpoints that any frontend (web, mobile, or desktop) can call. This clean separation means you can pick your favorite UI framework (for example, React, Vue, or Angular) without changing the backend.
-  **Monorepo-Friendly Structure**  
   The project folder is organized so that, in the future, you could add a frontend app right next to the backend (`apps/frontend/`). This shared workspace makes it easy to keep both parts in sync and share code like TypeScript types or utility functions.

## Backend Technologies

The heart of OpenCourse is its server-side application, which handles data, business logic, and all interactions with the database. Key components include:

-  **Node.js & TypeScript**  
   -  *Node.js* provides the runtime for the server—think of it as the engine that runs our code.  
   -  *TypeScript* sits on top of JavaScript and adds “type safety,” helping catch errors early and improving code readability.
-  **Drizzle ORM**  
   -  An object-relational mapper (ORM) that lets developers define database structures in code instead of writing raw SQL everywhere.  
   -  Automatically creates and tracks migration scripts (the files that change your database schema over time) and keeps a snapshot of changes for safety.
-  **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL)**  
   A tried-and-true way to store structured data—like courses, users, and permissions—in tables with clear relationships. Drizzle handles the connection and queries under the hood.
-  **Testing Framework**  
   Unit and integration tests live in a dedicated `__tests__/` folder. These tests verify that each piece of code and each API endpoint behaves correctly before changes go live.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Setting up the right environment and deployment workflow ensures the platform stays reliable and can grow over time:

-  **Monorepo Layout**  
   All code lives in one repository under the `apps/` and `drizzle/` folders. This makes it easier to share configuration, tooling, and versioning across the entire project.
-  **Version Control with Git**  
   All source code is managed by Git. This lets multiple developers work together, track changes, and roll back if needed.
-  **Database Migrations**  
   Drizzle’s migration scripts (in `.sql` files) and metadata (`meta/_journal.json`, `meta/snapshot.json`) keep track of every change to the database schema. This makes deployments predictable and reversible.
-  **Future CI/CD Integration**  
   While specific pipelines aren’t defined yet, the project structure is ready for continuous integration (automated testing) and continuous deployment (automated releases) on platforms like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins.

## Third-Party Integrations

OpenCourse keeps external dependencies to a minimum, focusing on core functionality. At this stage:

-  **No external services** are currently wired in (such as payment processors or analytics).  
-  The API-first design makes it easy to plug in services later—like Stripe for payments or Google Analytics for tracking—without major code rewrites.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Even in early stages, OpenCourse builds in safeguards and performance optimizations:

-  **Input Validation & Safe Queries**  
   Using Drizzle ORM helps prevent SQL injection because it escapes and validates inputs before running database operations.  
-  **Role-Based Access Control**  
   Authentication and authorization logic (e.g., student vs. instructor vs. admin) is handled in the backend, ensuring only allowed users can access sensitive endpoints.  
-  **Controlled Database Changes**  
   Migrations guarantee that schema updates happen in a predictable order, reducing downtime and data corruption risks.  
-  **Modular Code & Testing**  
   Keeping business logic, data access, and tests in separate folders speeds up development and helps catch performance bottlenecks early.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

OpenCourse combines proven, developer-friendly tools to deliver a robust backend platform:

-  **Node.js & TypeScript** for a fast, type-safe server environment  
-  **Drizzle ORM + Relational Database** for structured data management and reliable migrations  
-  **Monorepo Structure & Git** for organized code sharing and version control  
-  **Testing Suite** to ensure quality and prevent regressions

This setup aligns perfectly with OpenCourse’s goal: to provide a solid, maintainable foundation for managing open courses, while leaving the door wide open for any frontend, third-party service, or deployment platform you choose in the future.
