# opencourse App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new visitor arrives at the opencourse platform by following a direct link to the landing page. The landing page welcomes them with a concise description of the platform’s purpose, along with clear buttons for signing up or signing in. When the visitor chooses to sign up, they are guided to a registration page where they enter their name, email address, and a chosen password. After submitting these details, they receive a confirmation message and an email with a link to verify their address. Once they click the verification link, their account becomes active.

If a returning user wants to sign in, they navigate to the login page and enter their registered email and password. The system checks their credentials and, on success, redirects them to the main dashboard. For users who forget their password, there is a “Forgot Password” link on the login page. Clicking it prompts them to enter their email. The system then emails a secure reset link, which leads them to a page where they can choose a new password. After resetting the password, the user can sign in normally. Any time the user wishes to sign out, they click the Sign Out option in the account menu, which returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user lands on the main dashboard. The dashboard features a header with the platform logo, a search field for finding courses by name or topic, and a user avatar that opens the account menu. Along the left side, a vertical navigation bar lists links to key sections: Courses, My Profile, Settings, and for instructors or administrators, links to Course Management or Admin Panel. The central area of the dashboard displays cards or a list of courses. For student users, this shows recommended or enrolled courses. For instructors, it lists courses they have created along with quick access to create new courses. Each course card includes its title, a brief description, and a button to view details.

From here, the user can click on any navigation link or course card to move to the next page. The design ensures the user always sees the navigation bar and header, making it simple to switch between sections without losing context.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a student clicks on a course card, they go to the Course Detail page. This page presents the full course title, detailed description, list of modules, instructor information, and an Enroll button if they are not yet enrolled. Once enrolled, this button changes to “Start Course” or “Continue.” Clicking Start Course opens the first lesson page, which displays video content or text, with navigation controls to move between lessons.

Instructors access the Course Management section from the sidebar. They arrive at a list of their existing courses and see a prominent Create New Course button. Clicking that opens a form page where they fill in the course title, description, upload cover images or videos, and add modules one by one. Each module can include multiple lessons. After completing the form, they click Save as Draft or Publish. If they choose Publish, the course becomes immediately visible to all students. Instructors can later edit a published course by clicking its Edit button, which brings up the same form pre-filled with existing data. They can update text, upload new files, reorder modules, and then save changes or republish.

Administrators use the Admin Panel link to see an overview of all courses and all users. From here, they can click a user’s name to view or edit their profile and roles, or click a course to remove or flag it. Any changes made in the admin panel take effect immediately across the platform.

## Settings and Account Management
When the user clicks the Settings link in the navigation bar, they arrive at the Settings page. This page has sections for personal information, security, and notification preferences. In Personal Information, the user can update their full name, email address, and upload a new avatar image. In the Security section, they can change their password by entering the current password followed by a new one. In Notifications, they choose whether to receive email updates about new courses, enrollment confirmations, or announcements. After making changes, the user clicks Save Settings. A confirmation banner briefly appears, then the page remains in view so they can make further adjustments or navigate elsewhere.

When the user finishes in Settings, they can return to the Dashboard by clicking the platform logo in the header or selecting Courses from the sidebar.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters an incorrect password at login, an inline error message appears under the password field saying the credentials are invalid. The user can re-enter their credentials or click the Forgot Password link. On the registration page, if the email is already in use, an error informs the user and suggests signing in instead.

During course creation or editing, if the user leaves required fields blank or uploads an unsupported file format, the form highlights the problematic fields and displays a brief message explaining what to fix. If a network error occurs while saving, the platform shows a banner stating “Unable to save changes. Check your connection and try again.” Once connectivity is restored, the user can retry without losing their input.

If a user without instructor permissions attempts to access the Course Management page, they see a 403 Forbidden page with a message that they lack the required access and a button to return to the dashboard. A similar pattern applies in the Admin Panel: only administrators can enter, and unauthorized users receive a clear access-denied message.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a visitor lands on the opencourse landing page to signing up and verifying their email, they are smoothly guided into the platform. Once signed in, they encounter a role-based dashboard that serves as a hub for all actions, whether browsing courses, enrolling, creating content, or managing users. The flow between pages is intuitive, with persistent navigation elements ensuring users never lose their place. Error messages and password-recovery options keep users moving forward without frustration. In everyday use, a student quickly searches for new courses, progresses through lessons, and updates notification preferences. Instructors effortlessly build and publish new content. Administrators maintain overall health of the platform through the Admin Panel. This end-to-end journey ensures that opencourse delivers an efficient and cohesive user experience for every type of user.
